            Overall status:<br><br>
            I've had little to no problems with Travis and it has succesfully deployed the movie project.<br>
            The movie project is fully complete w/ tests.<br>
            JavaScript exercises from Wednesday is done with the exception of those marked as red.<br>
            Every exercise but the final red one is completed in the 'Dom Manipulation and Events' from Thursday.<br>
            I haven't had time to take a proper look at the fetch-API exercises.<br>
            Oh, and I changed the name on the linked repository on GitHub to a more fitting one but the name didn't<br>
            update on Travis. It's still working as it should though. Just thought I'd mention it.
